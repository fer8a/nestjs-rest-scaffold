<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is a great Framework to start building very robust server-side applications. There are many great templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this ~~very opinionated~~ one. I wanted a boilerplate that would integrate many of the great features Nest has to offer, _out-of-the-box_, with the minimun configuration effort to start bootstraping an application right away.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over; like integrating a DB layer, a microservice layer, etc.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life as well :)

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different, but here's for everyone who find it helpful.

### Built With

* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
* [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
* [Pino](https://getpino.io/)
* [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

Every time I start building an API, a REST microservice, a server-side app; there's always a set of features that I end up reusing over and over given the utility they provide. That's the main reason I have decided to create this project to bootstrap as much of this _core_ functionality as possible.

Let's list a few of the features provided on this project:
- Open Telemetry to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data.
- Terminus module for the healthcheck of your application exposed at `/health` route.
- OpenAPI specification ([Swagger](https://swagger.io/)) for all the `HTTP` routes (Thanks to NestJS CLI plugin).
- Global exception middleware so you can catch and customize any target exception to your likings.
- Global request-logger middleware so all the incoming and outgoing `HTTP` requests are logged by default with their metadata.
- Global Cache middleware to enhance the response time of all the `GET` `HTTP` requests.
- A programmatic way to access `environment` variables through DI.
- A database ORM to interact with mulple DB drivers using the great [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) package.
- A programmatic way to generate logs using DI upon the right context of your application.
- An example implementation of a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) transporter layer with a producer/consumer interface.
- Husky package with _lint-staged_ bundled with _pre-commit and pre-push_ hooks that running linter, formatter and tests

<!-- FOLDER STRUCTURE -->
## Folder Structure

Following the _Nest way_ of things, I ended up up with a module-based approach when it came to structuring the code.
That being said, the project comes with a series of folders and modules that you can reuse and extend to fit your needs, let's talk a bit about it.
- `config` Like its name implies is a folder to place all sort of configurations for your app. `cache` and `env` configurations live here. You can also and include more modules in it, like your `db` for instance, or any other module that relies on environment variables or externals configurations.
- `config/otel-tracer` Open Telemetry SDK and configuration file.
- `core` This is it, the source of ~~evil~~ the base code. It's a module wrapping the minimun functionality that the app should have, again this is very opinionated of me, so you may choose to adjust it to fit your needs.
- `db` Quite self explanatory, this is your DB module, the folder to place all your configs and ORM layer.
- `providers` Folder to place external third-party SDKs or libraries (AWS, Sendgrid, etc).
- `logger` Module where you can place the log driver that is going to be use by your app. Comes with Pino and Winston out of the box.
- `resources` Interfaces and endpoints with the bussiness logic of your app should be placed here. Modules, Controllers, Services and entities related to the solution you're building.
- `resources/healthcheck` This exposes the healthcheck functionality of your app to the `HTTP` transport layer.
- `transporters` Meant for all the microservices and interfaces other than `HTTP` that can se used in your app. Kafka, Redis, TCP, etc.
